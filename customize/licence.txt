Content
The Licensed Software enables the Licensee to enter content that will be stored on the computer on which the Licensed Software is installed (such content shall be referred to herein as the "Content"). Licensee is solely responsible for Licensee's use, storage and disclosure of the Content. Licensee may only use the Content responsibly, in a manner consistent with the exercise of good judgment. As website software, the Licensed Software will permit the Licensee to enter Content that constitutes non-public personal information of individuals other than the Licensee; the Licensee shall not use, store or disclose any such information without the express consent of the individuals to whom it relates. If Licensee is having difficulty deciding whether Licensee's intended use is appropriate, or whether Licensee needs written permission, or whether other legal issues should be considered, Welocallyª strongly encourages Licensee to seek competent legal counsel. Welocallyª will not assist Licensee in making this determination, nor can Welocallyª provide Licensee with legal advice as to intellectual property rights or privacy laws.

Licensee may only use Content which belongs to Licensee and will not violate the rights of others therein. Welocallyª will not edit or monitor Content; Licensee therefore assumes exclusive responsibility for the monitoring thereof. Licensee may not use the Licensed Software in conjunction with content that is illegal, obscene, indecent, defamatory, incites racial or ethnic hatred or violates the rights of others, or is in any other way objectionable.

If Licensee or Licensee's attorney determines that Licensee is required by law to obtain written permission to use portions of the Content, Licensee must request permission for reproduction, redistribution, or modification of the Content from the appropriate owner of the subject materials (as may be cited in the Licensed Software). If, on the other hand, Licensee or Licensee's attorney determines it is permissible to proceed and include Content from the Licensed Software, Welocallyª asks Licensee to correctly designate Welocallyª trademark(s) when referring to the Licensed software in the notice or copyright portion of Licensee's paper, project, or product.

Licensee shall indemnity, hold harmless, and defend Welocallyª and Welocallyª suppliers from all claims, damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and lawsuits that arise from, or result from, Licensee's use or distribution of Content and its use of the Licensed Software.


Software Updates
If the Licensed Software is an update to a previous version, Licensee must possess a valid License to the previous version. Any update provided by Welocallyª to Licensee is made on a License exchange basis such that Licensee agrees, as a condition for receiving an Update, that Licensee will terminate all of Licensee's rights to use any previous version of the Licensed Software. However, Licensee may continue to use the previous version only to assist in transitioning to the Updated version. Once an Update has been released, Welocallyª may cease support for prior versions, without any notice to Licensee.


Support
Welocallyª is not obligated by this EULA to provide Licensee with any technical support services relating to the Licensed Software; however, Licensee may order additional support services for an additional charge as Welocallyª may offer from time to time during the term of this EULA.

No Warranty on Licensed Software
The Licensed Software is provided to Licensee "AS IS." Welocallyª, and Welocallyª suppliers or affiliates, make no warranty as to its use or performance. Welocallyª, AND Welocallyª AFFILIATES, MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, OR TERMS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE, OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXCEPT FOR, AND TO THE EXTENT, THAT A WARRANTY MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN LICENSEE'S JURISDICTION.

Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL Welocallyª, OR Welocallyª AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR COSTS WHATSOEVER, OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF A REPRESENTATIVE OF Welocallyª OR ONE OF Welocallyª AFFILIATES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR COSTS, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN LICENSEE'S JURISDICTION. THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF Welocallyª, AND Welocallyª AFFILIATES, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, IF ANY.


Additional Terms for Beta Software
If the Licensed Software that Licensee receives with this EULA is pre-commercial release or "BETA" software ("Pre-release Software"), then, to the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this EULA, this section supersedes such conflicting term(s) and condition(s) as to the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Licensee acknowledges that the Pre-release Software does not represent the final product from Welocallyª, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, Welocallyª disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to Licensee of any kind whatsoever.

IN APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT MAY BE LIMITED, Welocallyª LIABILITY, AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE AND FIFTY UNITED STATES DOLLARS (U.S. $50.00). THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES TO ANY VERSION OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, PRE-RELEASE OR POST-RELEASE.
Licensee acknowledges that Welocallyª has not promised or guaranteed to Licensee that the Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, and that Welocallyª has no express or implied obligation to Licensee to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software. Welocallyª may decide not to introduce a product similar to, or compatible with, the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that any research or development that Licensee performs regarding the Pre-release Software, or any product associated with the Pre-release Software, is done entirely at Licensee's own risk.
During the term of this EULA, if requested by Welocallyª, Licensee will provide feedback to Welocallyª regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports.
If Licensee has been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, then Licensee's use of the Pre-release Software is also governed by that agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this EULA to the contrary, if Licensee is located outside the United States, Licensee will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software within 30 days of the completion of Licensee's testing of the Pre-release Software if that date is earlier than the date scheduled for Welocallyª first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial) Software.


Survival of Disclaimers
The exclusions of warranties, indemnification obligations and liability limitations shall survive the termination of this EULA, however caused; but this survival shall not imply or create any continued right to use the Licensed Software after termination of this EULA.

Licensee shall not ship, transfer, or export Licensed Software into any country or use Licensed Software in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions, or regulations applicable to the Licensee (collectively the "Export Laws") If the Licensed Software is identified as export controlled items under the Export Laws, Licensee represents and warrants that Licensee, and Licensee's employees who will use the Licensed Software are not a citizen, or otherwise located within, an nation embargoed by the United States (including without limitation: Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, and North Korea), and that Licensee, and Licensee's employees who will use the Licensed Software, are not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving the Software. All rights to use the Licensed Software are granted on condition that Licensee complies with the Export Laws, and all such rights are forfeited if Licensee fails to comply with the Export Laws.
