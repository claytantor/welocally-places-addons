== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q:Can I use Welocally Places for a blog hosted on wordpress.com?
A:No you can not. WordPress.com hosted blogs do not allow you to install plugins. Hosting your own blog gives you flexibility and allows you to monetize in new ways, so just take it to the next step and host your own blog. Consumer Rankings did a review of low priced hosting providers for WordPress. Check it out.
